# Mechanism comparison using the constant pressure reactor

This example shows using the constant pressure reactor of omnisoot (with soot deactivated) to compare the performane of severn reaction mechanisms to highlight the uncertainty introduced by chemical mechanisms in the prediction of carbon conversion flux from fuel (methane in this case) to larger hydrocarbon during methane pyrolysis in a shock tube.

The example corresponds to the section of *Uncertainties in gas chemistry* in [omnisoot paper](https://github.com/mohammadadib-cu/omnisootpaper/blob/main/main.pdf) that examines the following mechanisms (*The naming convention might not be universal):
